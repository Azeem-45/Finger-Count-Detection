✋ FingerSense — Real-Time Finger Count Detection

FingerSense is a computer vision project that uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect and count fingers in real time.
The system tracks hand landmarks through a webcam feed and displays how many fingers are raised with high accuracy.

This project demonstrates how AI-powered hand tracking and gesture recognition can be used for interactive applications like gesture-controlled systems, virtual sign recognition, and human-computer interaction.

⚙️ Getting Started
🔹 Prerequisites
