✋ FingerTrackAI — Real-Time Finger Counting Using OpenCV & MediaPipe

FingerTrackAI is a computer vision project built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe that detects and counts fingers in real time through a webcam feed.
It uses MediaPipe’s powerful hand-tracking model to identify hand landmarks and determine how many fingers are raised.

The project demonstrates real-time gesture recognition and can be extended to applications like gesture-controlled systems, virtual sign language interpretation, and human-computer interaction.

🚀 Features

Detects hand landmarks accurately in real time

Counts the number of fingers raised

Works with a standard webcam

Easy to run and modify for gesture-based projects

⚙️ How to Run
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
python finger_count.py


Once you run the script, your webcam will open and display the finger count live on screen.
